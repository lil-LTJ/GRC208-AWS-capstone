# GRC Platform Architecture Diagrams

This document contains the visual architecture diagrams for the AWS Integrated GRC Platform. These diagrams illustrate the system design, data flow, security layers, and deployment process.

## 1. System Architecture Overview

This diagram shows the complete AWS infrastructure, including the VPC layout, public/private subnets, core compute and database services, and the integration with AWS native security and monitoring services.
