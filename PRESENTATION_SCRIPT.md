## SLIDE 2: Problem Statement

### Slide Content
```
The Challenge

Organizations face increasing complexity in managing:
• Multiple compliance frameworks (ISO 27001, NIST, PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR)
• Continuous compliance monitoring requirements
• Risk assessment and mitigation tracking
• Audit logging and evidence collection
• Real-time security posture visibility
• Scalable infrastructure management

Traditional Approach:
❌ Manual compliance checks
❌ Spreadsheet-based tracking
❌ Siloed systems and data
❌ Reactive incident response
❌ Limited audit trails

Our Solution:
✅ Automated compliance monitoring
✅ Centralized GRC platform
✅ Integrated AWS services
✅ Real-time alerting
✅ Comprehensive audit logging
```

### Speaker Notes (2 minutes)

Let me start by explaining the problem we're solving. Modern organizations operate in a complex regulatory environment. They need to comply with multiple frameworks simultaneously, and they need to do it efficiently at scale.

The traditional approach to GRC is manual and reactive. Teams use spreadsheets to track controls, they conduct compliance checks on a schedule, and they often discover problems only after they've already occurred. This approach doesn't scale and creates significant security and compliance risks.

Our solution automates this entire process. We've built a platform that continuously monitors AWS resources for compliance, automatically assesses risks, and alerts teams in real-time when issues are detected.

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
- Complexity of modern compliance landscape
- Limitations of manual approaches
- Benefits of automation
- Real-time visibility

### Speaker Notes (3 minutes)

Let me walk you through the architecture. At the highest level, we have an AWS account containing a VPC with public and private subnets. This separation is critical for security.

In the public subnets, we have an Application Load Balancer that receives traffic from the internet and routes it to our application. We also have a NAT Gateway that allows resources in private subnets to access the internet without being directly exposed.

In the private subnets, we have three key components. First, ECS Fargate runs our containerized GRC application. This is where users interact with the platform. Second, RDS MySQL stores all our GRC data—frameworks, controls, risks, assets, and audit logs. Third, Lambda functions run on a schedule to monitor compliance and assess risks.

Supporting these core components are AWS native services. AWS Config continuously monitors our resources and checks them against compliance rules. CloudTrail logs every API call for audit purposes. Security Hub aggregates security findings. S3 stores evidence and reports. DynamoDB provides real-time compliance status. CloudWatch monitors everything and sends alerts. And KMS encrypts all our data.

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
- Defense in depth security
- Separation of concerns
- AWS native services integration
- Scalability and reliability

### Speaker Notes (2 minutes)

Our technology stack is carefully chosen to provide a robust, scalable, and secure platform. We use CloudFormation to define all our infrastructure as code, which means it's version-controlled, reproducible, and auditable.

For compute, we use Lambda for our compliance monitoring functions because they're event-driven, automatically scalable, and we only pay for what we use. We use ECS Fargate for our web application because it abstracts away the complexity of managing servers while still giving us the flexibility we need.

For storage, we use RDS MySQL for structured data because it's managed, highly available, and supports complex queries. We use S3 for evidence and reports because it's durable, scalable, and integrates well with other AWS services. We use DynamoDB for real-time compliance status because it provides fast, predictable performance at any scale.

For monitoring and compliance, we leverage AWS native services that are designed specifically for these purposes. This gives us deep integration and comprehensive visibility.

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
- Best-of-breed services
- Managed services reduce operational burden
- Scalability and reliability
- Cost optimization

### Speaker Notes (2 minutes)

Our platform supports six major compliance frameworks that cover most regulatory requirements organizations face today. Each framework has different requirements and focuses on different aspects of security and compliance.

ISO 27001 is a comprehensive information security management standard. NIST provides a flexible, outcome-focused framework that many organizations use as a baseline. PCI DSS is specifically for organizations that handle payment card data. HIPAA is for healthcare organizations. GDPR is for any organization handling personal data of EU residents. And SOC 2 is for service organizations.

The beauty of our platform is that it can map controls across these frameworks, identify overlaps, and help organizations understand how a single technical control can satisfy requirements from multiple frameworks. This is a significant operational efficiency gain.

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
- Comprehensive framework coverage
- Framework mapping and overlap identification
- Operational efficiency
- Regulatory compliance

### Speaker Notes (3 minutes)

Let me break down the five core modules of our platform.

The Governance module manages frameworks, controls, and policies. It's the foundation that defines what we need to comply with and what controls we've implemented. We've included 30 sample controls across different frameworks to demonstrate how this works.

The Risk Management module identifies risks, assesses them using a probability and impact matrix, and tracks mitigation efforts. We've included 6 sample risks to show different risk levels and how the system handles them.

The Compliance module is where the automation happens. It integrates with AWS Config to continuously monitor our resources, checks them against compliance rules, and tracks which controls have been implemented. This is the core of our continuous compliance monitoring.

The Audit & Evidence module ensures we have a complete audit trail. Everything is logged to CloudTrail, evidence is stored in S3, and we maintain a comprehensive audit log in our database. This is critical for compliance audits.

Finally, the Monitoring & Alerting module ensures we know immediately when something goes wrong. CloudWatch monitors our metrics, and SNS sends notifications when thresholds are exceeded.

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
- Comprehensive coverage
- Automation and efficiency
- Audit trail and evidence
- Real-time visibility

```

### Speaker Notes (2 minutes)

Let me walk you through how data flows through our system. It starts with AWS resources—EC2 instances, RDS databases, S3 buckets, and so on. AWS Config continuously monitors these resources and checks them against compliance rules.

When AWS Config detects a compliance status change, it triggers our Lambda function. The Lambda function retrieves the compliance data, calculates what percentage of our resources are compliant, assesses the risk level based on the non-compliance ratio, and stores the results.

The results are stored in two places. DynamoDB stores the real-time status for immediate access by the dashboard. RDS stores the historical data for reporting and analysis.

The dashboard displays this information to users. Reports are generated from the RDS data. CloudWatch metrics track the compliance percentage over time. And if the compliance percentage drops below a threshold, SNS sends an alert.

This entire flow is automated and happens continuously, giving us real-time visibility into our compliance posture.

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
- Automated data flow
- Real-time monitoring
- Multiple data stores for different purposes
- Alert escalation

---

## SLIDE 9: Risk Assessment Engine

### Slide Content
```
Risk Assessment Engine

Risk Calculation:
Risk Score = Probability × Impact

Risk Level Classification:
• CRITICAL: Non-compliance ratio ≥ 75% (Score 8-10)
• HIGH: Non-compliance ratio 50-75% (Score 6-8)
• MEDIUM: Non-compliance ratio 20-50% (Score 4-6)
• LOW: Non-compliance ratio < 20% (Score 1-4)

Example Calculation:
Total Rules: 20
Compliant Rules: 14
Non-Compliant Rules: 6
Non-Compliance Ratio: 6/20 = 30%
Risk Level: MEDIUM
Risk Score: 5.0

Alert Threshold:
Score > 7.0 → Send SNS Alert
```

### Speaker Notes (2 minutes)

The Risk Assessment Engine is one of the most important components of our platform. It automatically calculates risk based on our compliance status.

The calculation is straightforward: Risk Score equals Probability times Impact. The probability comes from our non-compliance ratio—if 30% of our resources are non-compliant, there's a 30% probability that a compliance violation will occur. The impact is typically high for compliance violations because they can result in fines, loss of certification, or reputational damage.

We classify risks into four levels. If more than 75% of our resources are non-compliant, it's critical. If 50-75% are non-compliant, it's high. If 20-50% are non-compliant, it's medium. And if less than 20% are non-compliant, it's low.

The system automatically sends alerts when the risk score exceeds 7.0, which gives teams time to investigate and remediate before the situation becomes critical.

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
- Automated risk calculation
- Data-driven decision making
- Clear escalation thresholds
- Proactive alerting

```

### Speaker Notes (2 minutes)

Our database schema is normalized and designed for both operational efficiency and audit compliance. Each table serves a specific purpose.

Frameworks define what we need to comply with. Controls are the specific requirements from those frameworks. Risks are potential threats to our compliance. Assets are the systems and data we need to protect. Compliance Status tracks our compliance percentage over time. And Audit Logs record every change for accountability.

The relationships between these tables are carefully designed to support queries like "Which controls are failing?" or "What risks are associated with this asset?" or "What changes were made to this control and by whom?"

This schema supports both real-time operational queries and historical analysis for compliance audits.

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
- Normalized design
- Audit trail support
- Relationship integrity
- Query efficiency

• TTL for automatic cleanup
• Streams for real-time processing
```

### Speaker Notes (3 minutes)

Let me dive deeper into the AWS services that power our platform.

AWS Config is the foundation of our compliance monitoring. It continuously watches our AWS resources and checks them against rules we define. When something changes or becomes non-compliant, it notifies our Lambda function.

Lambda is our automation engine. It's triggered by Config changes, analyzes the compliance data, calculates risk scores, and stores the results. Lambda is perfect for this because it scales automatically, we only pay for what we use, and we don't have to manage any servers.

RDS MySQL is our primary data store. It stores all our GRC data and maintains the complete audit trail. We use Multi-AZ deployment for high availability, so if one availability zone goes down, our database automatically fails over to another.

S3 stores all our evidence and reports. We enable versioning so we have a complete history of every document. We also store CloudTrail logs in S3 for long-term retention.

DynamoDB provides real-time compliance status. It's faster than querying RDS for frequently accessed data, and it automatically scales to handle any load.

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
- Service specialization
- Managed services reduce operational burden
- High availability and disaster recovery
- Scalability and performance

## SLIDE 12: Security Architecture

### Slide Content
```
Security Architecture

NETWORK SECURITY
• VPC with public and private subnets
• Security groups with least privilege rules
• Network ACLs for additional filtering
• NAT Gateway for private subnet internet access
• No direct internet access to databases

DATA SECURITY
• Encryption at rest (RDS, S3, DynamoDB with KMS)
• Encryption in transit (TLS 1.2+)
• KMS key rotation
• S3 versioning for data recovery

ACCESS CONTROL
• IAM roles with least privilege
• No hardcoded credentials
• Role assumption for cross-service access
• MFA for sensitive operations

AUDIT & COMPLIANCE
• CloudTrail logs all API calls
• CloudWatch logs application activity
• Audit logs in database
• S3 access logs
• 30-day log retention minimum
```

### Speaker Notes (2 minutes)

Security is built into every layer of our architecture. At the network layer, we use VPC with public and private subnets. Resources that need internet access are in public subnets. Databases and application servers are in private subnets and can only be accessed through security groups.

At the data layer, we encrypt everything. Databases are encrypted with KMS keys that we control. S3 buckets are encrypted. All data in transit uses TLS 1.2 or higher.

For access control, we use IAM roles with the principle of least privilege. Each service only has permissions to do what it needs to do. We never hardcode credentials; instead, we use IAM roles that services assume.

For audit and compliance, everything is logged. CloudTrail logs every API call. CloudWatch logs application activity. Our database logs all changes. And we retain logs for at least 30 days so we can investigate any issues.

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
- Defense in depth
- Encryption everywhere
- Least privilege access
- Comprehensive audit trail

### Speaker Notes (3 minutes)

Deployment is straightforward and can be done in less than an hour. We've provided both automated scripts and step-by-step instructions for maximum flexibility.

Phase 1 sets up the network infrastructure. We create a VPC with the CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16, which gives us plenty of IP addresses. We create public subnets for resources that need internet access and private subnets for databases and application servers. We create an Internet Gateway for public subnet traffic and a NAT Gateway for private subnet traffic.

Phase 2 sets up the database infrastructure. We create an RDS MySQL instance with Multi-AZ deployment for high availability. We create S3 buckets for evidence and reports. We create DynamoDB tables for real-time compliance status. And we create KMS keys for encryption.

Phase 3 deploys the Lambda function. We create an IAM role with the necessary permissions, package the Lambda function, and deploy it.

Phase 4 sets up monitoring. We enable AWS Config and create rules for the frameworks we care about. We enable CloudTrail for audit logging. And we configure CloudWatch alarms for key metrics.

Phase 5 loads the data. We load sample frameworks, controls, risks, and assets into RDS. We load sample compliance status into DynamoDB. And we run our test suite to verify everything is working correctly.

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
- Fast deployment
- Automated scripts available
- Comprehensive testing
- Production-ready
